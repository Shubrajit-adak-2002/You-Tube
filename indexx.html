            1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const<br>

            => Use var if you want function-scoped variables that can be hoisted. Use let if you want block-scoped
            variables that can be reassigned. Use const if you want block-scoped variables that are constant and cannot
            be reassigned.

            2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined<br>

            => This is because null is more explicit, and it shows that you, as the developer, intended for the variable
            to be empty. On the other hand, undefined is typically used by JavaScript itself to indicate that a variable
            has not been assigned a value.

            3.What do you mean by REST API?<br>

            => An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how
            applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms
            to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
